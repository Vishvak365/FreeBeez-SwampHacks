# About FreeBeez

As college students, we are often attracted to events with free food and swag. Clubs, Hackathons, and teams often use free stuff as a way of advertising and bringing people in, however the word might not get out. This app is meant to simplify the entire process for everyone. This app can not only be used for a fun topic such as free food for college kids but also more serious, impactful events such as emergencies. Being able to upload images on a pinpoint on a map and allowing emergency personnel to respond based on the geolocation pins and images could be very important. This app could also be adapted to help people with food insecurity find not only food, but also shelter and a place to sleep.
